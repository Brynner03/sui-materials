## About the Project

The main goal of this project is to learn SwiftUI through practical tutorials and examples provided in the book "SwiftUI by Tutorials" by the raywenderlich.com team. The project will include the code and projects I create while working through the book.

1. Introduction to SwiftUI
2. Understanding SwiftUI Architecture
3. Building a SwiftUI App
4. Data and SwiftUI
5. SwiftUI and Combine
6. Advanced SwiftUI Animations
7. Mastering Lists and Navigation

9. Building a Complete Project
10. Testing SwiftUI
11. Migrating to SwiftUI
12. Beyond SwiftUI
